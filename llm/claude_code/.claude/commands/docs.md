# Claude Command: Docs
This command helps you analyze and update CLAUDE.md files to improve Claude Code's performance and maintain project documentation consistency.

## Usage
To analyze and update project documentation, just type:
```
/docs
```

Or to update only the Project Status Summary & To Do's section:
```
/docs --status-only
```

### Parameters
- `--status-only`: Limits the analysis and updates to only the "## Project Status Summary & To Do's" section. This is useful for quick status updates without reviewing the entire documentation structure.

## What This Command Does

### Full Documentation Analysis (default)
1. **Discovery**: Automatically locates CLAUDE.md in current directory, then .claude/CLAUDE.md
2. **Analysis**: Reviews git changes, chat history, and existing CLAUDE.md to identify:
   - **Inconsistencies**: Where documentation conflicts with actual project state
   - **Missing Context**: Where Claude Code needs more detailed guidance  
   - **Redundant Content**: Where documentation can be streamlined
   - **Structural Issues**: Sections that don't match the standard template
3. **Recommendations**: Presents specific improvement suggestions with explanations and expected benefits
4. **User Confirmation**: Waits for approval on which improvements to implement
5. **Documentation Update**: Updates existing CLAUDE.md or creates new one using the standard template
6. **Quality Check**: Ensures documentation follows project structure and maintains consistency

### Status-Only Mode (`--status-only`)
When using the `--status-only` parameter, the command focuses exclusively on the Project Status Summary & To Do's section:

1. **Targeted Discovery**: Locates CLAUDE.md and identifies the "## Project Status Summary & To Do's" section
2. **Status Analysis**: Reviews recent git changes, commits, and project progress to determine:
   - **Completed Items**: Tasks that should be marked as ‚úÖ completed
   - **New Tasks**: Emerging priorities that should be added to the to-do list  
   - **Updated Priorities**: Changes in task importance or categorization (‚ö†Ô∏è Hardening, ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor, ‚ú® Features, üìã Documentation)
   - **Current Status**: Overall project state description updates
3. **Status Recommendations**: Presents specific updates to status items with reasoning
4. **User Approval**: Confirms which status changes to implement
5. **Targeted Update**: Updates only the Project Status Summary & To Do's section while preserving all other documentation
6. **Date Stamp**: Updates the "Updated" timestamp to reflect the current date

## Output Format

The updated CLAUDE.md should follow this structured template:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md
This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Workflow Instructions

### PLAN Mode (Analysis & Planning)
1. **Start in PLAN mode** for analysis and recommendation generation
2. **Discover documentation** - locate CLAUDE.md file (current directory, then .claude/CLAUDE.md)
3. **Review project context** - analyze git status, file changes, and chat history
4. **Identify improvement opportunities** - systematically review all sections or plan new structure
5. **Present recommendations** - provide clear explanations and expected benefits

### CODE Mode (Documentation Update)
1. **Switch to CODE mode** - only after user approves specific improvements
2. **Update documentation** - modify existing CLAUDE.md or create new one based on discovery results
3. **Follow template structure** - use established format for new files, maintain consistency for updates
4. **Preserve important context** - retain valuable information while removing redundancy

### Best Practices
- Focus on accuracy and consistency with actual project state
- Maintain clear, actionable guidance for Claude Code
- Use appropriate status indicators for tasks and features
- Keep documentation current with project evolution
- Preserve user-specific customizations and preferences

## Important Notes

### Integration with Other Commands
- If it has not already been run, use the `/prime` command first to understand full project context before analysis
- Consider running after significant project changes or feature additions
- Coordinate with `/commit` for version controlling documentation updates

### File Management
- Automatically discovers CLAUDE.md in current directory or .claude/CLAUDE.md
- Always backup existing CLAUDE.md before making changes
- Creates new CLAUDE.md in project root if none exists
- Ensures all placeholder content is replaced with actual project information

### Limitations
- Requires access to project files and git history for effective analysis
- Cannot automatically detect all project-specific requirements
- User review required for all suggested changes before implementation
- Will create CLAUDE.md in current directory if no existing file is found
