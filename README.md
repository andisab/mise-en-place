# Mise-en-Place - Dotfiles Management Framework

A macOS dotfiles configuration management system with centralized sync and modern tooling. 

## Overview

This repository provides a framework for managing configuration files across multiple applications and development tools using a hybrid Python + Shell approach for maximum compatibility and maintainability. It is configured for macOS systems, but can be adapted for other Unix-based systems. It is intended to be simple and intuitive to use with very deterministic results. Use it to get your IDE or LLM config set up quickly & easily. 

**Key Features:**
- üîÑ Bidirectional sync between repository and system
- üêç Python-powered configuration parsing with shell file operations
- üõ°Ô∏è Automatic backups before changes with rollback capability
- üì± Cross-shell compatibility (bash/zsh) with POSIX compliance
- üîç Interactive diff preview before syncing
- ‚ú® Multiple sync strategies (ask, replace, skip)
- üéØ Safe by default - always preview changes first
- üöÄ Quick install for zero-to-functional setup
- üîß Automated template processing with secure environment variable substitution
- üîí Security hardened - shell injection protection and environment file validation
- üìç Repository-agnostic design - works with any project name/location

## Quick Start - Automated Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/andisab/mise-en-place.git
cd mise-en-place

# Run automated setup
./install.sh

# When prompted "Run quick install? [Y/n]", press Enter to:
# ‚Ä¢ Validate configuration
# ‚Ä¢ Preview files to be synced
# ‚Ä¢ Sync dotfiles to your system with automatic template processing
# ‚Ä¢ Install shell integration

# That's it. You should be good to go! 
```
The quick install handles everything automatically. For manual control or customization, follow these steps instead: 


## Manual Setup (Advanced)

If you prefer to control each step or need to customize before syncing:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/andisab/mise-en-place.git
cd mise-en-place

# Review and customize dotfiles.conf. Uncomment only the files you want to import and manage. 
vim | emacs | nano dotfiles.conf

# Source the installation script
source install.sh

# If you plan on using sync functionality regularly, consider installing shell integration (one-time setup):
install_shell_integration

# Test configuration (safe - no file changes)
test_config

# Sync dotfiles from repository to system (with preview)
sync_dotfiles_from_git
```


## Configuration

All managed files are defined in `dotfiles.conf` using simple `repo_path:system_path` format:

```
# LLM & AI Assistant configs
llm/claude_code/CLAUDE.md:.claude/CLAUDE.md
llm/claude_desktop/claude_desktop_config_basic.json:Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```


## Template Processing & Environment Variables

The framework includes automated template processing with secure environment variable substitution:
- **Automatic Processing**: Templates are processed automatically after successful sync operations
- **Secure Substitution**: Uses `envsubst` for safe, reliable environment variable import & expansion with shell injection protection
- **Variable Detection**: Automatically discovers required variables from templates using regex analysis
- **Missing Variable Warnings**: Alerts you to undefined variables that may cause issues
- **Environment File Validation**: Validates `.env` files for security before processing
- **Atomic Operations**: Template processing uses secure temporary files with rollback capability
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS (in rare cases, may require `brew install gettext`) and Linux systems

### Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Copy the environment template (done automatically during sync)
cp ~/.config/dotfiles/.env.example ~/.config/dotfiles/.env

# 2. Edit and add your API keys/secrets (or just use your existing .env file, if you prefer, as configured in config_parser.py)
vim | emacs | nano ~/.config/dotfiles/.env

# 3. Templates are processed automatically during sync
sync_dotfiles_from_git  # Automatically processes templates after sync
```

### Requirements
The template processing feature requires `envsubst`. Check if you have it:
```bash
which envsubst || echo "envsubst not found"
```

On Mac OS & Linux, it's usually pre-installed with the `gettext` package.

If not found, install on macOS:
```bash
brew install gettext
brew link --force gettext  # May be needed if envsubst isn't in PATH
```

### Environment Variable Hierarchy

The system follows a clear precedence order when resolving environment variables (from lowest to highest priority):

1. **System Environment Variables** (lowest priority)
   - Variables already set in your shell (e.g., via `export VAR=value`)
   - These are checked first but can be overridden by any .env file

2. **~/.env** (middle priority)
   - Traditional location for global environment variables
   - Overrides system environment variables

3. **~/.config/dotfiles/.env** (highest priority)
   - Repository-specific location for this dotfiles system
   - Overrides both system variables and ~/.env

**How it works**: The system uses a "last-wins" approach where later files override earlier ones. When processing templates:
- First checks system environment
- Then sources ~/.env (if it exists and passes security validation)
- Finally sources ~/.config/dotfiles/.env (if it exists and passes validation)
- All environment loading happens in an isolated subshell for security

**Example**:
```bash
# System environment
export API_KEY="system_key"

# ~/.env
API_KEY="global_key"
DATABASE_URL="postgres://global"

# ~/.config/dotfiles/.env
API_KEY="local_key"

# Result: ${API_KEY} ‚Üí "local_key" (highest priority wins)
#         ${DATABASE_URL} ‚Üí "postgres://global" (from ~/.env)
```


## Additional Setup & Customization

### 1. Personal Information
- Update `llm/claude_code/CLAUDE.md` with your preferences and profile
- Configure git with your name and email using `git config`

### 2. Shell Configuration
- Your existing shell configuration files will remain untouched
- Use the custom overlay feature (below) if you want to manage shell configs through this repo

### 3. Choose What to Manage
- Edit `dotfiles.conf` and uncomment any additional files you want to import and manage
- Add new entries for any additional configuration or customized files you want to track

### 4. IDE and Tool Configurations
- The `ide/` directory contains templates for VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf
- The `llm/` directory contains templates for Claude Desktop and Claude Code
- Customize these based on your preferences

### 5. Custom File Overlays

The framework also supports personal dotfile customization that will take precedence over repository files:

```bash
# Custom files are stored in ~/.config/dotfiles.custom/
# Add custom overlay entries to dotfiles.conf using "custom:" prefix

# Example in dotfiles.conf:
llm/claude_code/CLAUDE.md:.claude/CLAUDE.md        # Standard mapping
custom:my-claude.md:.claude/CLAUDE.md              # Custom overlay

# Create your custom file:
mkdir -p ~/.config/dotfiles.custom
cp ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.config/dotfiles.custom/my-claude.md
# Edit the custom file with your personal settings

# When syncing, custom files take precedence over repository versions
sync_dotfiles_from_git  # Will use custom file if it exists
```

This allows you to maintain personal configurations and sync without concern for being overwritten by repository updates. 


## More Detailed Information

After sourcing `install.sh`:

- `quick_install` - Run the automated setup wizard (recommended for first time)
- `test_config` - Test configuration safely (no file changes)
- `validate_config` - Run detailed validation
- `sync_dotfiles_from_git` - Deploy repo configs to system (with preview + automatic template processing!)
- `collect_dotfiles` - Collect system configs to repo
- `process_env_templates` - Process configuration templates with environment variable substitution
- `install_shell_integration` - Add commands to your shell startup file
- `remove_shell_integration` - Remove commands from shell startup file

### Enhanced Sync Options

The `sync_dotfiles_from_git` command now includes automatic template processing and defaults to a safe preview mode:

```bash
# Default: Preview changes with interactive prompts + automatic template processing
sync_dotfiles_from_git

# Or use Python directly with more options:
python3 config_parser.py --sync-from-repo              # Interactive mode (default)
python3 config_parser.py --sync-from-repo --force      # Skip preview, apply all changes
python3 config_parser.py --sync-from-repo --strategy replace  # Replace all without asking
python3 config_parser.py --sync-from-repo --strategy skip     # Preview only, skip all changes
```
